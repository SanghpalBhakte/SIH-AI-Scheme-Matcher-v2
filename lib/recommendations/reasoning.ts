// "Recommendation Reasoning & Verification" — presentation-only logic
// layered on top of an already-computed SchemeMatchResult
// (lib/matching/engine.ts). Same discipline as explain.ts right next
// to this file: this NEVER recomputes matchScore, eligibilityStatus,
// or ranking, and never reads/writes any matching-engine weight or
// threshold. Every function here is a pure read of fields the engine
// (or the scheme record) already produced.
//
// Reason text (deriveMatchReasons) is sourced verbatim from
// `result.matchedCriteria[].label` — the exact strings
// lib/matching/engine.ts already generates for a matched criterion
// (e.g. "Designed for Woman entrepreneurs", "Available in Gujarat").
// Nothing here writes new claim text; it only selects and caps which
// already-produced labels are worth surfacing as a friendly "why"
// list. Like `describeAudience()` (lib/schemes/describe-audience.ts)
// and `Scheme.enhancedSupportFor.detail`, this generated text stays in
// English rather than going through t() — see scheme-overview.tsx's
// comment for the established precedent. Every STATIC piece of UI
// chrome around it (section titles, the verify-note sentences, the
// fallback string, the match-label words) is a real i18n key instead,
// per this feature's own translation requirement.

 *       → "Explore after verification" — either the engine doesn't
 *         have enough information to judge this scheme confidently, or
 *         a hard criterion didn't line up; both cases genuinely need a
 *         closer, human look (via the official source) before this

 * matching signal or an existing scheme field; none of it is
 * per-scheme invented text.
 *
 *   1. `missingCriteria.length > 0`
 *        → the engine itself doesn't have enough information to fully
 *          judge this scheme (e.g. income wasn't provided).
 *   2. `eligibilityStatus === 'Possibly Eligible'`
 *        → a soft criterion (sector/stage) didn't cleanly match, so
 *          this is only a partial fit even though nothing hard-failed.
 *   3. `scheme.additionalEligibleGroups` is non-empty
 *        → this scheme's category eligibility can be satisfied via a
 *          SELF-DECLARED special group (Minority/PwD — see
 *          EntrepreneurProfile.specialGroups), which nobody has
 *          verified.
 *   4. The scheme is state-specific (`!scheme.states.includes('All')`)
 *        → state schemes often carry real district/local-body-level
 *          implementation variance a nationwide rule engine can't see.
 *
 * Whenever ANY of the above applies, the universally-true funding/
 * window reminder is added alongside it — every real government
 * scheme's funding caps and application windows can change
 * independent of anything this prototype tracks, so it's never wrong
 * to say once the section is being shown at all.
